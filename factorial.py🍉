# Factorial Explanation:
# A factorial is a mathematical function that multiplies a number by all the positive integers less than it.
# It is denoted by n! and is defined as:
# n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 2 * 1
# 
# Special cases:
# - 0! = 1 (by definition)
# - 1! = 1
#
# Example:
# 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
#
# Factorials are widely used in:
# - Combinatorics (counting arrangements or combinations)
# - Probability (permutations and combinations)
# - Mathematical formulas and series expansions
