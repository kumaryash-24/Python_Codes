# A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or sequence that reads the same 
# forward and backward.

# Examples of palindromes:
# - Words: "madam", "racecar", "level"
# - Numbers: 121, 1331, 12321
# - Phrases (ignoring spaces and punctuation): "A man a plan a canal Panama"

# To check if a string or number is a palindrome:
# - Compare it with its reverse.
# - If they are the same, it is a palindrome.

# Palindromes are widely used in computer science, 
# especially in string processing and algorithm challenges.

#  Understanding [::-1] in Python
# [::-1] is Python slicing notation used to reverse a sequence (string, list, tuple, etc.).

# Syntax of Slicing
# sequence[start:stop:step]
# start â†’ Where to begin (default: 0).
# stop â†’ Where to end (default: end of the sequence).
# step â†’ Step size (default: 1).
# How [::-1] Works?
# start and stop are left empty, so it takes the entire sequence.
# step = -1, meaning it moves backward (from end to start), effectively reversing the sequence.
